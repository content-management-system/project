# Content Managment System for Monthly Magazine - Group Project
### Introduction
A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage web content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish.Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database. Think of them as huge, complicated Excel sheets.

However, instead of logging into the servers and trying to make changes one at a time, groups and individuals have created content management systems to help users communicate easily and efficiently with the database using a secure and easy-to-use interface. Most CMS’s are managed by companies or communities and updated as the web evolves.	

This is an introduction to the types of CMS’s and examples of what each platform can offer from blogging to eCommerce and everything in between. Our system will be for a subscription magazine service.

A content management system is composed of 2 major components. These are:

* A content management application (CMA) is a graphical user interface that allows its user to create, delete, modify, and publish content even without the knowledge of HTML or other programming languages ​​that are necessary to create web pages.
* A content delivery application (CDA) is responsible for the back-end services. It manages as well as delivers content after framed in the CMA.
